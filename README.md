## Design and Development Requirements
1. Attractive and Distinctive Design: The design should be visually appealing and distinctive to attract the attention of visitors and enhance their experience.
2. Full Responsiveness: The page should automatically adapt to various screen sizes and devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. The page should display correctly and flexibly on all devices without any display or formatting issues.
3. Improved Loading Speed: Design and development should be implemented in a way that aims to improve the page's loading speed, ensuring a comfortable and fast user experience.

## Operating Requirements
To ensure proper display and functionality of the landing page on different devices without any display issues, the following operating requirements should be met:

2. Use of Relative Units: It is recommended to use relative units such as em, rem, and % instead of fixed values like pixels (px). These units help achieve better compatibility across different screen sizes.
3. Design Testing and Advanced Debugging: The design should be thoroughly tested and debugged on a variety of devices and different web browsers to ensure proper and consistent functionality.
4. Code Optimization: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code should be cleaned and optimized to improve page performance and loading speed.
